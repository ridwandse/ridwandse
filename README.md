I am a trade economist interested in the intellectual property rights (IPRs) and dynamics of technology transfer through trade. Methodologically, I leverage on the recent advances in structural gravity models, standard panel data estimation techniques, and quasi-experimental methods for causal analysis to understand how IPRs influence the dynamics of international trade and economic development.
